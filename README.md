# MyPackage2.0
The site is live at [https://zijunye.github.io/MyPackage2.0/](https://zijunye.github.io/MyPackage2.0/)
## Overview 
The purpose of the website is to improve the workflow of package picking between the University of Ottawa post office and the school residence. 

## Problem/Challenge Define
As a student who has lived in a university dormitory for two years, picking up packages is always the biggest trouble for most of us and other residents because our packages are usually all collectively delivered to the Uottawa post office instead of directly delivered to the dorm downstairs. 
The process as follows: 
1. Once the package is delivered to the post office, the residence will receive an email from the post office that includes the package information and post office information. The email like the following snapshot:
   
3. The post office usually keeps your package in storage for around 2 weeks. If residents do not pick up before the due date, the post office staff will send back the package to the sender.
4. Residents have two options to pick up the package: either by themselves or picked up by other people(it has to be uOttawa students). If the resident selects ‘pick up by someone else option’, residents have to send an email to the post office that includes the name and student ID of the person who helped him/her pick up. 


From the following process, I find three main problem and I believe the process can be improve and become more productive through the application: 
- Problem 1: Residents can only track the received package by email. However, it is really hard to keep tracking the information through email since it also contains other irrelevant emails. 
- Problem 2: Resident unable to quickly calculate and keep updating how many days left need to pick up the package. Residents may often forget email or when a resident searches for the email from the post office, it is hard to identify whether the package is waiting for pick up or already picked up or sent back. 
- Problem 3: The communication between resident and post office is complicated. By now, if user need to someone pick up package, they need send email and when the person to pick up, post office staff also need to search the email that send by resident to confirm the information are match by both party.
